may have experienced or know someone who has experienced a financial scam.

Problems:
One of the problems we faced is that, because we used several frameworks and 
libraries, we had to stop what we were doing and get everyone up-to-speed on 
the dependencies. Oftentimes this would lead to malfunctions errors in the 
deployment, and we'd be stuck at the same point until it was all fixed. But 
the only way out was through, and we made sure everyone was all caught up with 
everything working.

Frameworks and libraries used:
Node.js,
React,
Express

Databases and cloud computing:
AWS RDS,
MySQL Workbench,
AWS Lex
Amazon Lambda
