Problems:
One of the problems we faced is that, because we used several frameworks and 
libraries, we had to stop what we were doing and get everyone up-to-speed on 
the dependencies. Oftentimes this would lead to errors in the deployment, and 
we'd be stuck at the same point until it was all fixed. But the only way out 
was through, and we made sure everyone was all caught up with everything 
working.

We created the application using a MVC structure, where a backend connects the 
frontend and database together, and it was the first time any of us have ever 
done this. It was difficult keeping the database together, but we used AWS RDS 
(something else no one had used before) to keep it collaborative and easy to 
access.

We wanted to create our own graphics, and we have artistic team members, but 
we didn't have any graphic design experience. Still, we all tried making 
graphics with Adobe Creative Cloud and were very happy with what we developed.
